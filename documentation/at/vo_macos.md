# VoiceOver for MacOS

VoiceOver is free and built in to MacOS.

## TODO

This information is still in development. Feel free to contribute. The following still needs to be done:

* Add information on how to capture output for tests (manual, copy/paste, etc)
* add details on how to find the version of the sr and os
* Proof read
* Ensure that the listed commands are accurate and make sense

## Install

VoiceOver is built in to MacOS and can be enabled from the System Preferences app.
