# VoiceOver for iOS

VoiceOver on iOS is touch based.

## TODO

This information is still in development. Feel free to contribute. The following still needs to be done:

* Add information on how to capture output for tests (manual, copy/paste, etc)
* add details on how to find the version of the sr and os
* Proof read
* Ensure that the listed commands are accurate and make sense

## Install

VoiceOver is built in to iOS and you can enable it from your Settings app.

## Guides, Documentation, and resources

* [Apple documentation](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision/)
* [Deque guides (PDFs)](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-ios-shortcuts)
